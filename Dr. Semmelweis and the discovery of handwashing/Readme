In this project, the data that made Dr. Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing is re-analyzed. 
The death rate of new-borns is plotted before and after Dr. Semmelweis made handwashing obligatory and the difference in death rate is calculated. 
A bootstrap analysis is performed to evaluate how much handwashing reduces mortalities.
